# Online-Store

This is an online store management system using Java, featuring functionalities for both shopkeepers and customers. Leveraging object-oriented programming principles, I implemented modular components for efficient inventory management and seamless user interactions. Responsibilities included designing the system architecture, implementing core features such as item addition and deletion, and ensuring robust error handling. I delivered a reliable and user-friendly solution that streamlined inventory management for shopkeepers and enhanced the shopping experience for customers. This project not only honed my Java programming skills but also strengthened my problem-solving abilities.
